<h3 align="center">Calculator</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The aim of this project is to develop a calculator for use in schools and will replace scientific calculators in the classroom. Physical scientific calculators often have a range of functions that is overloaded for school lessons. With this calculator, it should be possible in the future to control the range of functions remotely by the teacher, so that the range of functions can be individually adapted to the learning group.

Furthermore, the calculator will have an exam mode in the future. The teacher should be able to use log files to determine whether other apps were opened on the students' devices during the exam mode in order to prevent attempts at deception.

The calculator will be available for iOS and Android 

The Project is still in progress.

## Folder Structure



The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
